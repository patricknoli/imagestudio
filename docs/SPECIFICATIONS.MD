# Image Annotation Studio - Specifications

### Why Vite?
Beyond all Vite advantages listed on its [docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) I've decided to use it because of its easily config considering the pre-built templates. This help to not waste time on webpack configurations to directly focus on the App implementation itself. 

### Why Typescript?
In my opinion a typed code helps on maintenance and also facilitates the code reading and the understanding of each context inside the application.

### Why Tailwind + ShadCn/UI?
Tailwind has been used for thousands of developers on different types of projects, it provides pre-built styles that really helps us on write the code in a fast pace. In addition to Tailwind, I've opted to use ShadCn as my UI library, it gives us a full list of components built with Tailwind which is easily added in the application. It also has the advantage of high and fast customization so we can best adapt to the project context.

### Future implementations
To keep improving the product and user experience there is some considerable improvements and features that would fits well to the app purposes, such as:

-Multiple images upload
-Annotations edit
-Zoom image (for mobile devices)
